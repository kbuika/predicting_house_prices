# predicting_house_prices

In this model, I predict house prices given a dataset of some other houses.
I use Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Algorithm in order to improve the accuracy.

# Libraries:
pandas
numpy
tensorflow
matplotlib
sklearn
seaborn

# Accuracy
At first my model had an accuracy of 60%, this is because I had not filtered my data.
After filtering my data properly, I got an accuracy of 92.7%.
