# predicting_house_prices

In this model, I predict house prices given a dataset of some other houses.
I use Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting Algorithm in order to improve the accuracy.

# Libraries:
pandas
numpy
tensorflow
matplotlib
sklearn
seaborn

# Accuracy
60%

The accuracy is a little bit low though.
